      <h5 class="w3-center">Syerra Ryan</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">My name is Syerra, I'm in the 11th grade, and I go to McKinley Technology High School. I was inspired to enter the STEM field at a young age, so I always knew I would end up in a STEM field because I enjoyed it a lot. Now, I'm at Girls Who Code to figure out which field in STEM I want to do specifically as a career. You can do that by trying a lot of internships in high school that you are interested in to figure out what you want your career to be. </p>


      <h5 class="w3-center">Divya Mathews</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">My name is Divya. I'm in the 12th grade and I go to Lake Braddock Secondary School. I've always thought about having a STEM career but I didn't know if I would enjoy it. I found an internship in hopes that it would help me decide later on if that's the path I wanted to take.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Natalie Pargas</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">My name is Natalie, I'm in the 11th grade, and I go to Basis DC. Ever since I was a child, I’ve assumed that STEM fields were for the mathematically gifted and not for me. It wasn’t until I got plopped down in a STEM-focused school that I realized challenging things can also be rewarding. The pride of being placed in a higher math class than my (male) cousin, who was previously assumed to be much better in math than me, sparked a fire in me. I could be one of those glorified, genius STEM people! So the next year when an opportunity to learn Java was made available to me, I took it. Around 75% of the kids had already tried these various programming languages while I was a complete newbie. However, I worked at it until I finally figured out how to switch into the programmer's mindset. It was history from there.  </p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">Teresa Coreas-Reyes</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">My name is Teresa, I'm in the 11th grade, and I go to Don Bosco Cristo Rey High School. I've always been willing to try everything at least once. When I heard of the opportunity to have a STEM Internship, I was inspired to join so I could gain a new skill and insight into a new career for my future.</p>
